% f_t :
% Evaluation de la fonction second membre dans le cadre du probl√®me instationnaire.

% SYNOPSIS val = f_t(x,y,t)
%          
% INPUT * x,y : les 2 coordonnees du point ou on veut evaluer la fonction.
%       *   t : le temps
%
% OUTPUT - val: valeur de la fonction sur ce point.

% Original
val = 600*exp(-5*t)*exp(-((x-1)/0.8).^2-((y-1)/0.8).^2 );

% Autres tests
%val = 600*exp(-5*t)*exp(-((x-0.4)/0.8).^2-((y-0.4)/0.8).^2 );
